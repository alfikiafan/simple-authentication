# Simple Authentication System

The Simple Authentication System is a login, register, and logout system built using PHP, JavaScript, and CSS without any frameworks. It includes various constraints for input validation, session management, viewing profile details, editing profiles, and changing passwords. The system is designed using Bootstrap 4 for visually appealing user interface.

## Usage
To use the authentication system, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have a local web server capable of running PHP (e.g., XAMPP).
2. Import the database by running the `db.sql` script located in the `database` directory. This will create the necessary tables for the authentication system.
3. Configure the database connection in the appropriate file (`classes/DB.php`). Update the database credentials to match your local environment.
4. Access the system through your web browser, starting with the `index.php` file (e.g., `http://localhost/auth/index.php`).
5. Use the provided functionality for login, registration, profile management, and changing passwords.

Note: It is important to ensure that the necessary dependencies, such as PHP and MySQL, are properly set up on your local system before running the authentication system.
